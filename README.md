# sentiment-analysis

Recommender systems have become a very crucial application in the online market and e-commerce especially Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommenders which usually gives satisfying results.  However, their effectiveness deteriorates if there exist insufficient ratings, which is known as data sparsity, and data sparsity would further lead to a cold start issue. Existing methods address the data sparsity issue by applying token-level sentiment analysis that converts (illustrates) text review into sentiment scores (ratings) as a complement of the user rating. In this repository, we attempt to optimize the sentiment analysis with advanced NLP models including the use of deep learning models like RoBERTa, and use it to enhance the CF recommender.
